# Go Parallel Stream Library

## In the wild

* Java stream
* Scala view


## Directions

* Push/pull based:
* Fuse operations



## Usage

```go
  pstream.Of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)
    .MaxWorker(10)
    .Filter(isPrime)
    .ForEach(func(n int) {
      fmt.Printf("%d is a prime number\n", n)
    })
```

## Relevant work

* [BWbwchen/MapReduce](https://github.com/BWbwchen/MapReduce): Actual map reduce. Support distributed workers, fault tolerant, and states are presisted.
* [logic-building/functional-go](https://github.com/logic-building/functional-go): simiar similar to go-funk.
* [mariomac/gostream](https://github.com/mariomac/gostream): well written, with template, Java stream API.
* [thoas/go-funk](https://github.com/thoas/go-funk): functional programming lib.
* [reugn/go-streams](https://github.com/reugn/go-streams): data pipeline library. Kinda of map reduce.
* [robpike/filter](https://github.com/robpike/filter): apply and reduce.
* [samber/lo](https://github.com/samber/lo): go-funk but support parallel. The parallel impl simply applys go routine for each element. `WaitGroup` is used to synchronize between stages.

### Amazing relevant work

* [jucardi/go-streams](https://github.com/jucardi/go-streams): Lazy Java stream like. Able to controll parallelism.
