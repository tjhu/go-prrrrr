  \prr{}(**Go**lang **P**a**r**allel St**r**eam P**r**ocessing Lib**r**a**r**y) is a scalable parallel stream library in \go{} for efficient data pipelines.
  \go{} is known for building efficient large scale server applications with extensive use of asynchronous I/O because of go-routines(green threads) and go-channels(multiple-producer-multiple-consumer queues) are first-class citizens in \go{}.
  \prr{} makes use of these unique language features to experiment with various runtime optimizations of stream processing.
