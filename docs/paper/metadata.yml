  \prr{}(__Go__ **P**a**r**allel St**r**eam P**r**ocessing Lib**r**a**r**y) is a scalable parallel stream library in \go{} for efficient data pipelines.
  \go{} is known for building efficient large scale server applications with extensive use of asynchronous I/O because of go-routines(green threads) and go-channels(mpmc queues) are first-class citizens in \go{}.
  However
  This library is a proof-of-concept of various runtime optimizations of stream processing.
  \prr{} allows programmers to express complex pipelines concisely without sacrificing performance.
