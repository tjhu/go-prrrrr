# Introduction



Stream processing is a popular way to write data pipelines in modern programming languages. 
It allows programmers to express complex data pipelines in concise and readable manner while 
leaving rooms for optimizations for the compiler and the runtime.
Some of the most widely used stream processing libraries are Java's stream, C#'s LINQ, Scala's view, Rust's Iterator, and Python's functional.
Most of the exisitng libraries relies on them compiler to perform ahead-of-time(AOT) optimizations or language runtime to perform just-in-time(JIT) optimizations.
