  \newcommand{\prr}{\textit{go-prrrrr}}
  \prr{}(__Go__ **P**a**r**allel St**r**eam P**r**ocessing Lib**r**a**r**y) is a scalable parallel stream library in Golang for efficient data pipelines.
  This library is a proof-of-concept of various runtime optimizations of stream processing.
  \prr{} allows programmers to express complex pipelines concisely without sacrificing performance.
